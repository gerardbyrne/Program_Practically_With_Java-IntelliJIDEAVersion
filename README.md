## Program Practically With Java (IntelliJ IDEA Version)

The code in this repository relates to the modules of the book, **Program Practically With Java (IntelliJ IDE Version)**, available on the Amazon and Leanpub websites (**https://amazon.com/books/)(https://leanpub.com/**), and covers coding in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from JetBrains.

Other Integrated Development Environments exist such as NetBeans and Eclipse. 

Whilst the step by step instructions and screenshots in the book are based around the Intellij Community Edition, the step by step instructions can still be used by those preferring a different IDE. 

All code examples will run equally in any IDE.

All examples are fully commented to ensure we can understand the code and to enhance our knowledge of the Java programming language. 

Reading the comments in the code examples will enhance our understanding of Java and will help explain why the code does something or what the code is doing. 

The book is ideal for beginners, those refreshing their Java skills or those moving from another programming language. 

It is ideally suited for those students studying programming at high school or at university and for teachers who deliver Java programming lessons. 

The book offers detailed explanations and the code has excellent comments to support learning. 

By using clean code with proper naming the code is intuitive to read and understand. 

Reading the book is one thing but actually coding the examples using the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Integrated Development Environment is the most important thing if we wish to get the best understanding of the Java language. 

Hands on experience whilst reading the book is the key to success.

 

Another version of this book, **Program Practically With Java (Eclipse IDE Version)**, is also available with step by step instructions and screenshots for the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment. 

The code and examples in both books are the same.
